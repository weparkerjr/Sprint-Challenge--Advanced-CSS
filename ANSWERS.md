## Self-Study Questions

Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions.

Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager

1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

        A responsive website responds to the different browser and the adaptive website has specific layouts made specifically for each type of device or screen.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

        A mobile first design starts the design with a mobile view first and then uses media queries to respond to the changing sizes. A desktop first design reverses that process and have media queries that use "max-width".

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?

        It is a cheat that was figured out that allows us to use decimals in the rem units. For example, we can use 1.6rem instead of 16px for a font size. This is very helpful for user accessibility in our website design.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

        Preprocessing allows the website designer to use a nesting structure that follows the html code closely. This help organize our css better. It is then compiles this cod with a compiler such as the watch-less-compiler in the CLI and outputs into the css.index file in a native css format for the html file to use.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

        I love the fact that it organizes the code better and it allows us to simplify it by using different files.

        Keeping up with the multiple files when you're first working on a website that uses LESS can be pretty overwhelming. I think that concept of mixins and parametric mixins is tough to sort out because you have to know what bit of information is being use and where it is being used.

You are expected to be able to answer all these questions. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. Skipping this section *will* prevent you from passing this challenge.
